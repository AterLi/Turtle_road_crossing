# Turtle Crossing Road Game

This game is a simple replica of the classic "Cross the Road" game using the Turtle graphics library in Python. The objective is to guide a player-controlled turtle across the road while avoiding obstacles represented by other cars.

# Usage
Download the provided code files (main.py, player.py, car_manager.py, and scoreboard.py) and save them in your game project directory.

To run the game, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to your game project directory, and execute the following command:

python main.py

The game window will appear, and you can control the player-controlled turtle using the "Up" and "Down" arrow keys.

# Gameplay
The game starts with a player-controlled turtle at the bottom of the screen. The objective is to guide the turtle across the road to the top without colliding with any of the cars.

As the turtle successfully crosses the road, the score increases, and the speed of the cars increases.

If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends, and the final score is displayed.


# Acknowledgments
This game is inspired by the classic "Cross the Road" game, which was originally created by Code Club in the UK. The code provided here is a simplified version of the original game, and it uses the Turtle graphics library for Python.
